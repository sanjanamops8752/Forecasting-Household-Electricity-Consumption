# Forecasting-Household-Electricity-Consumption
Given the rise of smart electricity meters and the wide adoption of electricity generation technology like solar panels, there is a wealth of electricity usage data available.  This data represents a multivariate time series of power-related variables that in turn could be used to model and even forecast future electricity consumption. In this project,  you will discover how to develop a test harness for the ‘household power consumption’ dataset and evaluate three naive forecast strategies that provide a baseline for more sophisticated algorithms.

This project is divided into four parts and they are:

1. Problem Description

2. Load and Prepare Dataset

3. Model Evaluation

4. Naive Forecast Models
